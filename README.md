# ▶️ Project Summary
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive exploratory data analytics solution highlighting Uber delivery rides. The primary goal is to empower business analysts, product managers, and strategy teams with actionable insights into customer behavior patterns using various visualizations. The project is implemented using Python within Jupyter Notebooks, developed in the PyCharm environment.

The analysis explores Uber delivery data covering ride details, timestamps, locations, and fare amounts. Through extensive exploratory analysis including temporal, geospatial, and customer segmentation visualizations, this project aims to reveal patterns that support data-driven decisions in delivery operations and strategic planning.

# 📊 Key Features
● Comprehensive EDA Pipeline: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and profiling on Uber delivery rides dataset.

● Rich Visualization Suite: Interactive charts like histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps, and bar graphs to illustrate demand and delivery trends.

● Temporal Analysis: Insights on delivery frequency by time of day, day of week, and seasonal trends.

● Geospatial Exploration: Analysis of pickup and dropoff locations to identify hotspots and delivery clusters.

● Customer Behavior Patterns: Identification of peak ordering times, order values, and common delivery distances.

● Segmentation and Clustering: Grouping delivery rides by region, time, and order characteristics for targeted operational insights.

● Clear Documentation and Codebase: Well-structured Jupyter notebooks compatible with PyCharm for reproducibility and ease of collaboration.
